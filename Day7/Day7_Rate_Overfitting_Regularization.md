# 1. Rate 

###### 1. what is it ?

: it is a Learning Rate for running algorithm



###### 2. Characteristic

1 > Larger values cause overshooting .

2 > Smaller values change the response slowly .

# 2. Overfitting



###### 1. what is it ? 

: Occurs when creating a model that fits well with training data. 



###### 2. Characteristic 

1> Training data fits very well 

2> It is not a model appropriately applied to other data. 



Solution : more training data, reduce the number of features, **Regularization**

# 3. Regularization 

###### 1. what is it ?  

: Normalize the value to make the algorithm suitable for application.
