### 1. Machine Learning

***

<i><b>Machine Learning</b></i>  is a field of development that was born due to limitations in expect programming, a program in which developers set rules. It is a development area where programs can automatically learn rules and learn for themselves.

##### 1) Supervised Learning

This is a method of progressing learning <u>_with labeled data_</u>.

<i>Labeled data</i> means that input data and output data are predefined. This data is called <b>training data</b>. After training with this <b>training data</b>, we can measure how accurate the algorithm is through the <b>testing data</b>.

+ <b>Regression</b>
It is a way of predicting <u>continuous valued</u>. 
<i>Ex) To predict student's test scores.</i>
<br>

+ <b>Classification</b>
It it a way of predicting <u>categorical valued</u>.
<br>

    + <b>Binary Classification</b>
Category is only two, for example (yes / no) or (1 / 0).
<i>Ex) To predict student's pass of fail.</i>
  

    + <b>Multi-Class Classification</b>
It has many category, for example (Small / Medium / Large).
<i>Ex) To predict student's grade, for example (A / B / C / D/ F).</i>

##### 2) Unsupervised Learning

This is a method of progressing learning <u>_without a label for data_</u>.

It is often used to discover hidden features or structures of data.

- <b>Clustering</b>
This is a method of grouping data with similar characteristics.
