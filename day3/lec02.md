Learn about Linear Regression model and it's cost function<i>Cost(W,b)</i>

### 1) Linear Regression

To predict data tend to be linear equation.

### 2) Hypothesis

Linear equation used in Linear Regression. Hypothesis H(x) is repeatedly modified by iteration of model. We use final ‘educated’ Hypothesis to predict test dataset.

### 3) Cost Function

Function to calculate cost of W and b value.
We educate model to minimize cost at each iteration.

### 4) Goal

Our goal is to find the W(slope) and b value, which minimize the cost function.
